# How to Add Your Logo to Rise to Thrive Academy Website

## Quick Steps:

1. **Prepare Your Logo:**
   - Format: PNG, JPG, or SVG
   - Size: 200x200 pixels or larger (recommended)
   - Background: Transparent (PNG) works best
   - Name: `logo.png`

2. **Replace the Logo File:**
   - Go to: `rise-to-thrive-mastermind/public/` folder
   - Delete the current `logo.png` file (it's broken)
   - Add your logo file named `logo.png`

3. **That's It!**
   - Your logo will automatically appear on all pages
   - No code changes needed
   - The logo appears in headers and footers across the site

## Logo Appears On:
- Main landing page
- Foundation course pages (landing & sales)
- Mastermind course pages (landing & sales)
- Advanced course pages (landing & sales)
- All checkout pages
- All footer sections

## Different Logo Name?
If your logo has a different name (like `my-company-logo.png`), either:
- **Easy**: Rename it to `logo.png`
- **Advanced**: Ask for help updating the code references

## Logo Sizes Used:
- **Headers**: 80x80 pixels (20x20 on mobile)
- **Footers**: 64x64 pixels (16x16 on mobile)
- **Auto-responsive**: Scales beautifully on all devices

## Troubleshooting:
- If logo doesn't appear: Check file name is exactly `logo.png`
- If logo is too big/small: The CSS will automatically resize it
- If logo looks blurry: Use a higher resolution source image
