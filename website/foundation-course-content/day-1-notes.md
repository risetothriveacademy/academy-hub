## 🧠 Core Teachings
- Trauma creates **spiritual, emotional, and neurological imprints**  
- Strongholds distort truth + identity  
- Patterns of fear, shame, guilt, and confusion become mental programming  
- Many believers fight the *symptoms* instead of the *root cause*  
- Healing begins when you **expose the unseen battle**
